## Troubleshooting Reference

### Common Issues

**500 Error**

- Check storage/ permissions (must be 775)
- Check .env file exists and is readable
- Check storage/logs/laravel.log for errors
- Verify PHP version >= 8.1

**404 on all pages except homepage**

- Check mod_rewrite is enabled
- Verify .htaccess file exists in public/
- Check .htaccess RewriteBase if in subdirectory

**CSS/JS not loading**

- Verify APP_URL in .env matches domain
- Check public/build/ directory exists
- Clear browser cache

**Database connection error**

- Verify database credentials in .env
- Check database server hostname
- Ensure database user has correct privileges

**Blank page / white screen**

- Enable error display temporarily (set display_errors=On in php.ini or .htaccess)
- Check PHP error logs
- Check storage/logs/laravel.log

### Emergency Rollback Plan

1. Enable maintenance mode: `php artisan down`
2. Restore previous version files
3. Restore database backup
4. Clear all caches
5. Disable maintenance mode: `php artisan up`
